<h1>Custom door chime using a Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p> Using a magnetic (reed) door sensor and a(n) <s>PIR</s> <s>ultrasonic</s> IR distance sensor to detect and entering and exiting status</p><p>A friend of mine asked me to hack a door chime that he found on Amazon to play a custom sound file. I decided to build one from scratch (almost) using a Raspberry Pi and some sensors. The sensors part of that statement is explicitly vague as it took me a bit of trial and error to determine what sensor really worked for my purpose.</p><p>Goal: make a door chime that plays a random selection from a list of sound files that are loaded on to a USB drive. Catch: the door sound is different depending on whether someone is entering or exiting.</p><p> A quick search brought me to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/sitcom-sfx-door-trigger/code">this great tutorial on Adafruit</a>, but a.) it was coded using Python and b.) as I found out later, not entirely performant in my case with the PIR. I wanted this thing coded using Rust and so began my little journey...</p><p>To be continued...</p>
