<h1>Sparkfliers... sparkflies?</h1>
<p>Here at Sparkfly we are passionate about exploring all tech related to wireless, whether it be LoRa, LongFi, WiFi, HaLow, you name it, we are interested. We are especially curious when it comes to integrating this wireless tech with open source and Linux.</p><p>In order to explore this passion we are here to make and break things. Making things from scratch using open source is our bread and performance testing is our jam. We find it especially useful when others post their results and findings and we plan to do the same here.</p><p>Our main Spark in Chief and the guy that will be writing the most articles here is me. My name is Gary Suyemoto and I'm an Army Infantry veteran, former Air Guardsman, father of two, tech guy with web development experience, extreme dabbler, business owner, and definitely no expert in wireless communications. I do plan to bring in some experts for guest posts, but in the meantime, hope to learn from you and others!</p>
