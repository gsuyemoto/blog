It's been about 2 years now that it came out that my father was having issues that were directly related to his oncoming dementia. After having a debilitating fight with double pneumonia that put him in the hospital, my father's dementia really started to bloom. The dementia, or as it has been diagnosed now as Lewy Body Dementia (yeah, I never had heard of of it either until Robin Williams), had actually reared it's potent head during his frightful hospital stay, but some of us had marked it up as the seriousness of the pneumonia upon on his elderly state.

After my father was released from the hospital, which he fought tooth and nail to escape, I think it was my mother who mentioned how he was having hallucinations even before his 3 day stint at Valley Occupational Medical Center. He had been seeing people in the house long before she said, which was definitely news to me. I was quite confused. Why hadn't she said something before? Why hadn't it manifested whenever I came to visit at least once or twice a month?

As I drive, it all seems so far in the past now. From the time we realized Dad was probably coming down with dementia, to this day where we struggle daily to handle the day to day care essential for his condition. It feels to me like it went downhill pretty quickly, but maybe not in retrospect. I have a lot of time to think while driving now. It's a 1hr drive one way to my parent's house if I'm lucky and the gods of LA traffic are good to me. In most cases, they are downright hateful.

It was today, on my tired drive back from having pulled a 13.5hr shift overnight at my parent's house, that I came to the realization. Having, like most nights before, to deal with the mental stress of my Dad. Some nights are OK, but many are not. This night was about a 4-5 on a scale of 1-10 for stress. Not so bad.

It dawned on me as noon passed. My Dad has had a huge problem with fear and he's given it to me.
