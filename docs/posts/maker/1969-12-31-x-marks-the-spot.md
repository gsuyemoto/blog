I had owned my Glowforge for about a year and finally had decided to try out the passthrough slot. A friend of mine was opening a new coffee and tea [shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/press-coffee-and-tea-brea-2) (you should check it out if you are in the Brea, California, area) and had asked me to help him out with a sign. The sign dimensions were going to be around 30"x30" and I knew that obviously this would not work without the passthrough. Some of it probably wouldn't work with it.

When it finally came time to cut the pieces with the passthrough slot, I went online and visited the Glowforge manual to see how this was to be done. Lo and behold, the only information available was to how to remove the panels to make the passthrough slots available for material AND how to put said slots back on.

Nice.

I decided to send an email to Dan and the gang at Glowforge asking for some enlightenment. Their reply was an email referencing 3 links to 3 separate posts by members of the Glowforge community on how they decided to tackle this problem. From this, I inferred that there was in fact no official guidance or manual as to how to actually USE the passthrough slot and that Glowforge themselves would not be providing much assistance.

Personally, I was not satisfied with this reply and asked for a manager. Here is the reply from the manager:

> Right now we don't have great direction on how to make alignment work best on your passthrough projects and this is why we've directed you to the wonderful folks on the Forum. But I can tell you that we're in early beta testing on software that will make your passthrough cuts seamless for each section.

> In the mean time here's a few best practices for working with the passthrough slot. 

> Before you print, check that your material is longer than your design.

> Try to keep the material straight from the start so that your print doesn’t end up off the edge of the material.

> Don’t lift the lid between printing the sections except when prompted on the screen.

> You can also take a look at our [Glowforge Pro support page](https://glowforge.com/support/topic/using-your-glowforge-pro/printing-glowforge-pro#moving-material-through-passthrough) which talks through some of the best techniques for getting the most out of your passthrough slot.

Um, so in my personal experience, they have been advertising how this passthrough slot is your way to making magical creations like this lamp:

I really doubt they made that without the passthrough. They love to provide it in all of their commercials and ads and was the big reason to pay the extra $2000 for the PRO version of the Glowforge. This was over a year ago and they still don't know how it works? I just think it would have been nice if they mentioned that somewhere in their site or ads or anywhwere.

OK. So I'm not trying to bash Glowforge. Maybe a little. I mean, they do deserve it when it comes to this feature of their very much premium priced device. Overall, I do like my Glowforge a LOT and have, of late, created a lot of cool things on it, but sheesh, they really could have been a bit more transparent about the passthrough.

So, here I was with 3 links and a deadline to make my friends sign. I checked out the 3 links, tried some tests with the knowledge from them and decided they were not really going to work for me. Back to the drawing board. After a week of my own testing and going through a bunch of different methods, I came up with one that I felt would work well enough for me. X, or rather, a + plus sign marks the spot.

### Method Man

The method I present here is probably still a work in progress. I don't pretend to be some expert, but I do feel this method works better than the ones I've come across. If this method leads to an explosion or a raging fire or a ruined project, then don't blame me.

### Step 0

For this method, I explain how to do everything using Inkscape. Unless you cut a very large design with a lot of engraving, prepping the design file is what is going to take up most of your time in this endeavor.  It took me about a day to a day and a half to put the design file together. The design file that I made for this blog includes a stock photo site vector file, so unfortunately I won't be able to provide the design file that I used here, as I don't have the full rights to that vector design. Instead, I created a simpler design file with all the same elements needed for passthrough laser cutting with your Glowforge.

Some of the key points you need to be cognizant about are:

- The ACTUAL cutting area/size of the Glowforge (19.5x11)
- Extra spacing on the side to add registration marks
- Separation of tasks into different operations using colors
- Ensuring registration marks are a stroke width of 0.01"
- In your vector file, keep stuff organized nicely in named layers!

### Step 1
