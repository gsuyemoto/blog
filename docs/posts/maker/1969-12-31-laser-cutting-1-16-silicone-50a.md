As the coronavirus has ravaged many of the states, I have embarked upon a couple of new and interesting projects to help out a little.

After spending about a couple of weeks designing, I have come up with a vector design file for both a face shield and ear savers that are entirely made from using a laser cutter instead of a 3D printer.

In this article, I will be discussing the material I chose for the ear savers. After some research using 4 different materials (acrylic, nitrile/Buna-N, silicone 30A, and silicone 50A), I decided on 50A silicone. If you don't know, the difference between 30A and 50A is it's [durometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer#Durometer_scales) value. The 50A is not as elastic, but also does not have as much sag and therefore tends to retain it's shape a bit better when using it to put the mask on.

I purchased my initial materials for testing mostly from Grainger, but already had a bunch of acrylic on hand. The nitrile rubber I had bought in 3 different sizes, finally deciding on 1/16" as it was easier to cut with the laser. The one size at 3/16" I wasn't even able to cut through with 3 passes of the laser at full power, so I let that one be... After testing, I didn't really like the nitrile as it seemed too brittle and had a weird smell (although this could be attributed to just inventory from Grainger – as you will see later in this article).

The silicone was a bit more expensive, but it cut really well and didn't have any weird smells. Plus, it seemed a bit more elastic and therefore more durable for this application. My initial tests were done with material from Grainger, but I found another source with a company called Rubber Cal which was located not very far from me. A 1/16" thick sheet of silicone at 50A and measuring at 3'x10' set me back $155.70, which a seemed like a pretty good price after buying from Grainger. As I found out after receiving the silicone from [Rubber Cal](https://www.rubbercal.com/), it was an even better deal as the silicone seemed to be far less brittle than the 50A silicone I purchased from Grainger. The silicone from Grainger tended to break even if I put, what seemed to me, a small bit of tension on them.

So, we had a winner: the 50A silicone from Rubber Cal.

Here are the Glowforge settings I used to cut the 50A 1/16" silicone from Rubber Cal:

- CUT--> Speed: 280 | Power: Full | Passes: 3 | Focus Height: 0.065"
- ENGRAVE--> Speed: -- | Power: -- | LPI: -- | Passes: --

NOTE: You can cut the silicone with only 2 passes, significantly reducing the time to cut large/intricate projects, but then you spend much more time tearing them out of the sheet. I chose to spend less time tearing them out of the sheet.

After laser cutting over 200 ear savers as of the writing of this article, I can provide these tips:

1. Use gloves when dealing with large/intricate projects as there is a fair amount of silicone dust left/produced when removing the cut from the sheet.
2. Have a shop vac handy, for the same reason as the dust mentioned above.
3. Make sure that the silicone sheets are completely flat. I used generous amounts of painters tape along the edges of the sheet. It seemed when the laser cut the sheet where it was not flat, the cut would tend to be more shallow – thus more time having to tear the piece out of the sheet instead of it nicely dropping out.
4. For large projects, I washed the cuts with dish soap and water. When processing dozens of pieces at a time, I placed all of them in a container full of dish soap and agitated the pieces with my hand. After, I set up a clothesline and hung the pieces on the line to dry.

I noticed a large flame when cutting the silicone, but nothing ever even came close to igniting. The exhaust from the Glowforge combined with the temperature resistance of the silicone itself is what I presumed aided in this regard. Despite the flame, I personally felt quite safe cutting hundreds of pieces.

In the end, I was pleasantly surprised with how well the ear savers turned out and made a couple of other small pieces that were used for some face shields. I definitely plan on using this material for other projects in the future!

Please take a look at a couple of videos I posted of cutting the ear savers and making the face shield!
