I've recently jumped on the 3D printing bandwagon. It actually wasn't by choice. I had made a purchase for a professional UV flatbed printer for my business and the company had thrown in a desktop 3D FDM printer for free as part of a promotion. At first, I just wanted to turn around and sell the FDM printer, but after checking out it's probably selling price (after having been hobbled by proprietary firmware which prevented it from using anything other than PLA), I decided to keep it.

There were some ideas of making some custom sunglasses frames in my mind for a while as we also own a company that had sold prescription eyewear for a time and then switched to all computer glasses. So, I went about making some sunglasses frames on the FDM printer (more on that in another post?). I was actually pleasantly surprised by the ease of which it took me to a.) use the FDM printer and b.) learn to use Blender well enough to make the models to print.

Even though the quality of the frames was better than I had initially anticipated, it was still a bit lacking. Also, I definitely was sure that PLA was not going to cut it as a material. I was then curious to see how the frames looked when printed on a resin printer. My nephew had a resin printer and volunteered it's use, but when I came across a contest on Instructables I decided to go all in and try to make an LCD or MSLA resin 3D printer from some devices I had lying around.
