In this article, I'm working with States Industries SoyStrong 1/4" NAF Plywood (Maple). You can find this plywood [here](https://www.lowes.com/pd/SoyStrong-NAF-1-4-in-HPVA-Maple-Plywood-Application-as-4-x-8/1000096494). I'll provide some tips and Glowforge settings that have worked for me.

Glowforge settings:

- CUT--> Speed: 160 | Power: Full | Passes: 1
- ENGRAVE--> Speed: 1000 | Power: 90 | LPI: 225 | Passes: 1

I first tried cutting the 4x8 sheet into manageable pieces for my Glowforge. I was using an Evolution circular saw with a 7-1/4" multi-material blade that has 20 teeth. This was a mistake and I found that I needed to get a different blade real quick. 

Tips for cutting with traditional woodworking tools:

- Use a blade with at least 30 teeth
- Cut with finished side up

Some observations about this material:

- Actual thickness for the sheet I bought was .21"
- Seems a bit brittle
- Some delamination at edges where laser has cut
