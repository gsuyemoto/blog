## What Are Microtasks for Cryptocurrency?

A sizable portion of the population is currently looking for alternative ways to earn money outside of (or perhaps in addition to) a traditional employment situation. Some of them have turned to the Internet to look for ways to increase their earning potential, and many who do that end up stumbling across the concept of a microtask.

The definition of a microtask, as provided by[ cryptoticker.io](https://cryptoticker.io/en/earn-bitcoin-microtasks/), is as follows:

Microtasks are small, manageable tasks that, in most circumstances, anyone, anyplace can achieve online in exchange for a tiny fee. Companies normally present Microtasks for market research or marketing objectives.

What this means is that for just a tiny chunk of one's time, it is possible to earn a small piece of a cryptocurrency that may add some value to one's life and bank account. The reward for completing the task is often very small, but the task itself is also often very easy and doesn't take a lot of time. However, the person who completes many of these tasks over a period of time can start to see their efforts pay off. They accumulate the cryptocurrency, and it will ideally increase in value in their account as time goes on.

## Are Microtasks a Legitimate Way to Earn?

A few of the ways that you can tell an offer is most likely legitimate are as follows:

- **The Entity Offering the Work Has A Good Reputation** - If the person or business offering the microtask has a good reputation in the community and in society as a whole, then you can rest assured that they are likely going to honor their word and provide a reward for the individual who completes their task. Many websites offer the opportunity for previous microtask workers to rate their experience, and these ratings are often public. If you see that the entity you want to work with has a good reputation with previous workers, then you can feel more confident.

Thus, you always want to check that the task being offered is something that seems to fit into the mold of tasks that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. If not, you might be looking at someone trying to extort work out of you.
- **The Cryptocurrency Offered Is One You Have Heard Of **- There are so many different cryptocurrencies available now that it is challenging to keep up with all of them.
