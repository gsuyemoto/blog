Here at Sparkfly we are passionate about exploring all tech related to wireless, whether it be LoRa, LongFi, WiFi, HaLow, you name it, we are interested. We are especially curious when it comes to integrating this wireless tech with open source and Linux.

In order to explore this passion we are here to make and break things. Making things from scratch using open source is our bread and performance testing is our jam. We find it especially useful when others post their results and findings and we plan to do the same here.
