Just some notes on various types of connections you will find on most PCB boards and modules (think wifi cards, wifi USB, wifi modules, SDRs, etc.).

I've been going through quite a collection of wifi modules for my router project and it seems that the there are a variety of connection types and cables (of course!). Here is a picture of the Nano slot that I'm using:

The wifi modules that fit in that slot apparently come with different types of connectors for their antenna.

The Lantronix has an mmcx and the Mediatek has a u.fl connector.
