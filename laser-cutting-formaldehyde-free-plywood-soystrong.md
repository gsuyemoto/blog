<h1>Laser Cutting Formaldehyde-Free Plywood (SoyStrong)</h1>
<p>In this article, I'm working with States Industries SoyStrong 1/4" NAF Plywood (Maple). You can find this plywood <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/SoyStrong-NAF-1-4-in-HPVA-Maple-Plywood-Application-as-4-x-8/1000096494">here</a>. I'll provide some tips and Glowforge settings that have worked for me.</p><p>Glowforge settings:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>\
    <li><bold>CUT</bold>--> Speed: 160 | Power: Full | Passes: 1</li>\
    <li><bold>ENGRAVE</bold>--> Speed: 1000 | Power: 90 | LPI: 225 | Passes: 1</li>\
</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I first tried cutting the 4x8 sheet into manageable pieces for my Glowforge. I was using an Evolution circular saw with a 7-1/4" multi-material blade that has 20 teeth. This was a mistake and I found that I needed to get a different blade real quick. </p><p>Tips for cutting with traditional woodworking tools:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>\
    <li>Use a blade with at least 30 teeth</li>\
    <li>Cut with finished side up</li>\
</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Some observations about this material:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>\
    <li>Actual thickness for the sheet I bought was .21"</li>\
    <li>Seems a bit brittle</li>\
    <li>Some delamination at edges where laser has cut</li>\
